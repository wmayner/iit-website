      //-   h1 Open positions
      //-   p Several postdoctoral positions are available in the integrated information theory group at the
      //-     a(href='http://centerforsleepandconsciousness.med.wisc.edu') Wisconsin Institute for Sleep and Consciousness
      //-     | in the laboratory of Dr. Giulio Tononi.
      //-   p Candidates are expected to have strong training in an analytically rigorous discipline such as theoretical biology/neuroscience, physics, mathematics, computer science, or engineering. We explicitly encourage mathematicians to apply. Experience in information theory, complex systems, and an interest in the philosophy of mind/information/causation are a plus.
      //-   p Programming experience is required (knowledge of MATLAB, Python, and/or C++ is of advantage).
      //-   p Applicants should send a CV, brief statement of previous research and future research interests, and email addresses and phone numbers of three references to Dr. Giulio Tononi (
      //-     a(href='mailto:gtononi@wisc.edu') gtononi@wisc.edu
      //-     | ).
